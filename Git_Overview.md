# Git Overview

The way that GitHub works is that you have two versions of your code, the remote and the local. The remote is the code
visible on GitHub to whomever has access to the repository, so that’s the code that we’ll be seeing and grading. The local
is the code on your computer as you work on it.

So whenever you have a project on GitHub you will work on it on the local copy, and when you finish a task, you’ll add it,
commit, and push to the remote. This serves to share it with whomever you’re collaborating with, and give you access to
versioned back-ups. The second is particularly important as it means that if things break, you can use your commit log to
find the last point things worked and see exactly what the changes made after that were so you can find the bug.

### Useful Links

Below are Tutorials for Git and the command line on Codecademy. They are by no means manadory, but may be useful if you
want to learn more.

[Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) (Most relevant is part 1 and possibly 2, but 3&4 are still good
to know)

[Learn Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (Again 1 and 2 most relevant, but 3&4 are cool
to have, especially 4 can customize your command line)
